# Randolio: Skydiving
A fun script for parachuting with friends or as a solo for QBCore.

Originally wrote this like a month ago but decided to tweak it a little bit and add some extra stuff.

## Features:
- Config options for group fees, solo fee and fuel export.
- Plane and ped is synced with everyone.
- Small 5 minute cooldown between flights.
- Parachute is automatically set to the player when getting into the vehicle. (Switching to a weapon may make it disappear but yeah just don't do that? lol)

Shoutout to this guy who gave me the idea to add a "solo jump" option using the "dodo" plane that lets you sit in on the side, pretty cool.
