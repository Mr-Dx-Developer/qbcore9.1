# qb-chains
Usable necklace items with some sampled chains from GTA5mods

This is my first ever release so don't expect anything amazing! 
I wanted usable necklaces rather than people being able to just get them from clothing as wanted to add a player owned jewelry shop in my city.
There's probably hundreds of these elsewhere but i didnt want to look so i made my own.
Chains will now remove from person if item is dropped or given away

I will provide the chains i used in the stream folder for anyone wanting to use them or you can customise the script for your own.
Tested on updated QB-Core works with no issues, some chains won't appear over certain clothing due to the thickness.

I have provided instructions on how to add more chains please make sure you read it carefully. 
Thank you.
